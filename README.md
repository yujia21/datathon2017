## Concatenate Datasets
- Inputs: downloaded data from folder data/ with naming convention: "Chiller1_ConFlow_201706.csv" for June 2017
- Change the second cell accordingly for the chiller number and datatype. 
- Combines data from May to November 2017 and puts into one file
- Outputs: "data/Chiller1_ConFlow_full.csv"

## Merge Datatypes
- Inputs: full datasets generated by Concatenate Datasets
- Keeps only important columns and concatenates by each minute values from Power/Temp/Conflow/Evaflow
- Outputs: "data/Chiller1_full.csv"
- Note: *NEW* Inputs includes external temperature data, saves as "data/Chiller1_full_ext.csv"

## Prediction-METHOD.ipynb
- Prediction and optimization for chiller (step 1 and 2)
- Inputs: "Chiller1_full.csv"
- Try different methods, evaluate best learning model on test set
- Perform optimization, get optimized chiller variables

## Prediction-METHOD-w cooling tower.ipynb
- Prediction and optimization for cooling tower (step 3 and 4)
- Inputs: "Chiller1_full_ext.csv"
- Try different methods, evaluate best learning model on test set
- Use optimized chiller variables before to predict power and optimize cooling tower variables
